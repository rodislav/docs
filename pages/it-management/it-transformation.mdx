# During the transformation

1. Manage the Day-to-Day and allocate resources for the transformation.
2. Communicate clearly with the stakeholders about the progress and impacts.
3. Define the following base-line: *No big updates are to be developed for the existing business*.
4. Do not expect the transformation to be completed in a year or two.
5. It'll impact everyone: customers, partners, business, employees.
6. It is not possible to have a smooth transition, but it is possible to manage it effectively.
7. Risk-based approach must be used.

# Main decisions to take

> The result of these decisions will be used to pick the right approach based on elements described bellow.

1. Do we want to rebuild the business with the new technology **OR** do we want to transform the business as well and adapt it to existing realities?
2. Are we transforming the entire business **OR** a part of it?
3. Do we want to get rid of something **OR** keep all we have?

# Two ways

1. Big Bang.
2. Incremental.

## Big Bang

1. Useful when you rebuild the business from scratch.
2. **Expensive** and **Dangerous**, as the new system must live next to the old one and bring no value to the business.
3. A risk-based approach must be used will be negative to this way.

> To mitigate the risks associated with this approach, a new company must be created and an **incremental** approach used on top of it. Then move the customers to the new system when ready. So from some customers perspective, it's a big bang, but not from the business perspective.

## Incremental

1. Useful is most cases.
2. You start with the small and non-impactful parts of the business.
3. Make the delivery lines run smoothly.
4. Then start transforming the critical parts.

# Elements of the transformation

1. Transformation Team (*key element of success*).
2. Target Business Model.
3. Target Operating Model.
4. Target Process.
5. Target Technology.
