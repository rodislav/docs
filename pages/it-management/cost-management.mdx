# What costs money?

1. Regulatory burden.
2. Turnover.
3. Hyped technologies.
4. Slow updates.
5. Manual processes.
6. All the layers between C-Level and the Delivery Teams.
7. Work which is not part of the core business.

# How to spot excessive costs?

1. You want to buy a solution, and you are contacted by more than two people from the seller.
2. You cannot get a quote without a meeting.
3. You are asked to sign an NDA before getting a quote.
4. You are asked to sign a contract before getting a quote.

# What to do about it?
- **Clean Code**, it is not just a buzzword, it is a way to reduce costs by reducing the time spent on:
    - Maintenance - existing code can get fixes .
    - Updates.
    - Onboarding new developers.
- **Clean Architecture**, because it allows you to:
    - Change the technology stack without rewriting the whole application.
    - Reduce the time spent on updates.
    - Reduce the time spent on onboarding new developers.
- automate
- reduce steps in proc√©dures
- delegate non core business activities
- group up with companies with similar problems and create small companies solving specific problems (bancomat, kyc, paper shredding, etc)
- start counting ROI, how much you gain on each transaction?
- reduce midle management
- delegate trust
- use portable technology
