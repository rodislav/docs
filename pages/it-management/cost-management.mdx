# What costs money?

1. **Regulatory Burden**, you do not have the *critical mass* to comply with regulations.
2. **Turnover**, the employees are leaving with knowledge, skills and connections while the new ones have to learn everything from scratch. You shall expect a drop in the productivity of the team, between 2 and 9 months.
3. **Hyped Technologies**, building mission-critical software using hyped technology will explode risks and costs if this technology loses its audience.
4. **Slow Updates**, leaving the software not updated for more than 1 year will make it critically vulnerable to security vulnerabilities. The security risks area increasing every year between 20 and 60 percent, prior to the previous year.
5. **Manual Processes**, letting humans doing the job based on *documented* procedures, without automation, lead to errors and delays, which impact the deliveries. Each delayed delivery incurs costs for consultants, developers, QA, operations, management, reputation, etc.
6. **Middle management layers between C-Level and the Delivery Teams**.
7. **Not Core Business Work**, all resources spent on *not-important* and *not-urgent* and building stuff which is not part of your core business.
8. See [Eisenhower Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenhower_Matrix).
9. **Excessive License Costs**, using expensive software because "*it can do stuff*".

# What to do about it?

## Clean Code and Clean Architecture

> Tired of hearing discussions about:
> - *25 Man Days to build a skeleton microservice.*
> - *70 Man Days to add a flag on a given data structure.*

| Area        | Benefit                                                                          | Before                                 | After                                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Maintenance | Existing code can be quickly fixed                                               | 4 hours, 2 developers (*1 MD*) per bug | 0.5 to 1 hour, 1 developer per bug    |
| Updates     | Moving the technology stack to a superior version becomes financially meaningful | 200 of MD for 50 microservices         | 1 - 2 hours with AI or 50 MD manually |
| Onboarding  | New team members will understand the code just by reading it                     | 2 weeks to be productive               | Can push to main branch after 1 day   |

## Automation

| Area               | Benefit                                                                                                                         | Before                                                    | After                                                      |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| CI/CD              | New code can be deployed in matter of minutes in any environment, including PROD                                                | 5 days, 1-2 developers, 1 system engineer                 | 5 - 10 minutes, 1 developer                                |
| Self Service ITSM  | Submitting requests and delivering a service for a new laptop, get access to a resource, etc. becomes fast and always compliant | up to 6 months of talks, meetings, emails, 2-15 employees | 1 hour - 10 days, 1 employee, 1 manager, 1 system engineer |
| Project Management | Everyone knows what is the actual status of a given project or all the projects from all the portfolios, in a compliant way     | 1 reporting at the end of the month, not correct          | Instant                                                    |

## Steps in procedures

Use the following rules to approve or remove steps in procedures:

1. Is this step reducing the costs?
2. Is this step a compliance requirement?
3. Is this step a security requirement?
4. What are the exact boundaries of this step?
5. What prevents this step from being automated?
6. What prevents this step from being removed?

## Non-Core-Business activities

1. Is this activity a core business activity?
2. Is this activity a regulatory requirement and shall it be done internally?

If not, then:

1. Compare the TCO of doing it internally with the TCO of externalizing it.

## Start counting global ROI, how much you gain on each transaction?

1. Move your finance to **FinOps**.
2. https://www.finops.org/introduction/what-is-finops/
3. Apply these practices to your business.

Check the following:

1. Describe the entire flow of making a transaction and put a price on each step
2. Define why each step costs that much
3. Start optimizing each step, but do not over-optimize, leave a *wiggle room*.

## Other

- Group up with companies with similar problems and create small companies solving specific problems (*bancomat, kyc, paper shredding, etc.*)
- Reduce Middle Management.
- Delegate trust to Team Leads.
- Use portable technology, not one specific to a given cloud provider.

# F.A.Q.

## How to identify excessive license costs?

1. You want to buy a solution, and you are contacted by more than two people from the seller.
2. You cannot get a quote without a meeting.
3. You are asked to sign an NDA before getting a quote.
4. You must use consultancy services to put in place the solution, example:
    1. Such services are not free.
    2. Such costs can amount to 1.000 EUR per day, per consultant, and the minimum number of days is 20.
    3. So you'll have to pay about **20.000 EUR per year** for customization, support, etc. **on top of the license costs**.
5. You are asked to sign a contract before getting a quote.
6. You split the cost of the license per item this software has to manage, example:
    1. Licenses cost of an Incident Management Software, split per total numbers of incidents per year.
    2. If the license cost is 80.000 EUR per 1 year, and you have 15 incidents per year, on average, the cost becomes **5,300 euro per incident**.
