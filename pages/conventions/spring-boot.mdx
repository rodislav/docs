<Info>
  **Note**: This document outlines the coding conventions when using Spring Boot framework.
</Info>

# Code structure

- Use ``src/main/java`` for application code.
- Use ``src/main/resources`` for configuration files.
- Use ``src/test/java`` for unit tests.

# Code style

- Use constructor-based dependency injection.
- Do not use `@Autowired` annotation for dependency injection.
- Do not use field dependency injection.
- Avoid using method-level annotations for dependency injection.
- Use `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` annotations to define service, repository, and controller classes respectively.
- Use `@RestController` for RESTful controllers.
- Use `@Component` for generic components.
- Use `@Configuration` for configuration classes.
- Use suffixes like `Service`, `Repository`, `Controller`, and `Configuration` for class names.
- Do not use `@Value` annotation for injecting configuration properties, instead use `@ConfigurationProperties` for binding configuration properties to classes which are used via constructor injection.
- Use spring configuration processing features like `@ConfigurationProperties` for binding configuration properties to classes and generate properties files for auto-completion.
- Use `@Bean` annotation to define beans in configuration classes.
- Avoid using `@ComponentScan` annotation, instead use `@SpringBootApplication` annotation which includes component scanning by default.
- Avoid using `ResponseEntity` for returning responses, instead use `@RestController` annotation at the class level.
- Use `.properties` files for configuration, and avoid using `application.yml` or `application.yaml` files.
- Use DTOs for data transfer objects.
- Use `@Transactional` annotation only if it is required.
- Only use `@Transactional` annotation in the classes annotated with `@Service` annotation.

# Logging

- Use `org.slf4j.Logger` for logging.
- Use `org.slf4j.LoggerFactory` for creating loggers.
- Use `org.slf4j.MDC` for logging context.

# Lombok

- Favor using `@Getter` and `@Setter` annotations instead of `@Data` annotation.
- Favor using `@RequiredArgs` annotation, and define as **final** internal variables that are required for the class to work.


# JPA Entities

- Use `@Entity` annotation for JPA entities.
- Use `@Id` annotation for the primary key.
- Use `@GeneratedValue` annotation for primary key generation.
- Use `@Column` annotation for columns.
- Use `@Table` annotation for tables.
- Use `@OneToMany` annotation for one-to-many relationships.
- Use `@ManyToOne` annotation for many-to-one relationships.
- Use `@JoinColumn` annotation for joining columns.
- Use `@Transient` annotation for transient fields.
- Use `@SequenceGenerator` annotation for sequence generators.

- For complex primary keys, use composite keys.

- Avoid using entity relationships, instead use IDs to link entities, including for collections.
