# Ignoring files

- If `.git` folder does not exist, run `git init` in the project root.
- Create `.gitignore` file at the root of the project.
- Include these entries by default:
    - ```gitignore
        # Ignore build directories```
          /build/
          /target/

          # Ignore IDE files
          .idea/
          *.iml

          # Ignore logs
          *.log

          # Ignore local stuff
          *-local*

          # Ignore environment files
          .local.env

          # Ignore OS-specific files
          .DS_Store
          Thumbs.db
      ```

# Branching
- Use `main` as the default branch.
- Use **TBD Trunk-Based Development** branching strategy.
- Use feature branches for new features or bug fixes.
- Merge to `main` when every day.
- Split changes into small commits.
- Always rebase before merging.
- Do not sync branches to environments.
    - Example: do not use a `dev` branch to sync to `dev` environment, or `uat` to `uat` environment.
- Releases are done from `main` and are generating tags.
- Tags are corresponding to released versions.
- When a hotfix is needed:
    - Create a branch from the tag that corresponds to the affected version with the name `hotfix/TAG-reason-for-hotfix`.
    - Then create a new release from this branch and a corresponding tag.
    - If the changes are deemed meaningful, merge to `main` and delete the hotfix branch.
    - The merge can be a backporting or cherry-picking if the changes are not straightforward.
