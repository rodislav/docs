# General

- Do not use `mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd` files, instead use `mvn` command.
- Use `mvn clean package` command to build the project.

# XML structure of the `pom.xml` file

- https://maven.apache.org/pom.html
- Use the following XML structure as example to organize high-level tags inside the `pom.xml` file:

```markdown
    - project
        - parent
        
        - groupId
        - artifactId
        - version
        - packaging
        
        - properties

        - dependencies
        - dependencyManagement
        
        - profiles
        
        - modules

        - build
        
        - scm
        - distributionManagement
        - name
        - description
        - url
        - inceptionYear
        - licenses
        - organization
        - developers
        - contributors
      
        - issueManagement
        - ciManagement
        - mailingLists
        - prerequisites
        - repositories
```

# General principles

- Organize dependencies in the `dependencies` section by grouping them by `scope` and keeping the following order:
    - `compile` for compile-time dependencies.
    - `provided` for dependencies that are provided by the runtime environment.
    - `runtime` for dependencies that are required at runtime but not at compile time.
    - `test` for test dependencies.
- Use **properties** to define common values that can be used across the project.
- Use **properties** to define version values of the dependencies.
